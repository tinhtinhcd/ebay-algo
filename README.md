This is some interview questions from ebay.


Q1. Given an unsorted integer array,  find the largest sum in a contiguous subarray.
E.g. [1,2,-4,3,4,-1,4,5,-10], the result is sum([3,4,-1,4,5]) = 15. And how to design it in a web service.

Q2. Given a list of binary trees, find the largest sum for a subtree.

Q3. Implement binary search

Q4. Given an unsorted array and a target, return the minimum length of continuous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target.
E.g. [1,2,3,1,4,3], target = 7, return 2, because the minimum length of continuous subarray is [4,3]

Q5. implement singleton with enum and synchronized

Q6. Given a list of running time range for a server with start time and end time, no overlap, [[0,30], [35,40], .... , [100,104], [105, 110]], input a time point, return check whether the server was running at that point

Q7. Rotate array Inplace. https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/
