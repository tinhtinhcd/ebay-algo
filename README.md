This is some interview questions from ebay.


Q1. Given an unsorted integer array,  find the largest sum in a contiguous subarray.
E.g. [1,2,-4,3,4,-1,4,5,-10], the result is sum([3,4,-1,4,5]) = 15. And how to design it in a web service.

Q2. Given a list of binary trees, find the largest sum for a subtree.

Q3. Implement binary search.

Q4. Given an unsorted array and a target, return the minimum length of continuous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target.
E.g. [1,2,3,1,4,3], target = 7, return 2, because the minimum length of continuous subarray is [4,3]

Q5. implement singleton with enum and synchronized

Q6. Given a list of running time range for a server with start time and end time, no overlap, [[0,30], [35,40], .... , [100,104], [105, 110]], input a time point, return check whether the server was running at that point

Q7. Rotate array Inplace. https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/

Q8. Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.  
- Example 1:
  - Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2.   
  - Output: [1,2].  
- Example 2:   
  - Input: nums = [1], k = 1.   
  - Output: [1].  
- Note:   
  - You may assume k is always valid, 1 = k = number of unique elements.
  - Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

Q9. Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.
The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.
